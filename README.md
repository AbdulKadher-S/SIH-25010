## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Theme
Agriculture, FoodTech & Rural Development

## Proposed Solution
We propose to build a multilingual AI-powered mobile app that provides farmers with personalized crop and fertilizer recommendations, weather alerts, pest/disease detection, and market price updates. The app will support local languages and voice input to assist farmers with low digital literacy. This solution is unique because it combines AI, IoT, and NLP technologies in a simple and accessible platform tailored for small farmers.

## Technical Approach
Technologies: Python (AI/ML models), Flutter (mobile app), Firebase/Cloud, TensorFlow (image recognition), IoT sensors for soil data.

Process:
1.Collect soil, weather, and crop history data.
2.Run AI model to generate recommendations.
3.Provide advisory via app/chatbot in local language.
4.Farmers upload pest images for disease detection.
5.System improves continuously with farmer feedback.

## Feasibility and Viability
Feasible because AI/ML, IoT, and cloud technologies are already available.
Challenges: Internet access in villages, language diversity, low literacy.
Solutions: Offline app mode, SMS-based alerts, voice/chatbot interface, partnerships with agriculture officers.
## Impact and Benefits
Social: Farmers get trusted advice in their own language.
Economic: Higher yield, reduced costs, better income.
Environmental: Reduced chemical use, sustainable farming.
