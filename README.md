## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Proposed Solution
We propose a smart crop advisory platform that works as a multilingual mobile application and chatbot. The app will provide personalized crop suggestions, soil health recommendations, weather-based alerts, pest/disease identification through image upload, and local mandi price tracking.

Farmers with low literacy can use the app through voice commands and audio feedback in their own regional language. The advisory will be based on real-time weather data, soil reports, and past crop history, ensuring higher accuracy and relevance.

The uniqueness of our solution lies in its integration of AI, IoT, and NLP (Natural Language Processing) with a farmer-first design that is simple, accessible, and localized.
## Technical Approach
Technologies to be used:
AI/ML – Crop recommendation, pest detection, fertilizer advisory.
NLP (Natural Language Processing) – Multilingual chatbot and voice support.
IoT Integration – Soil sensors for real-time soil health monitoring.
Cloud Computing – Data storage, analytics, scalability.
Mobile Development – Flutter/React Native for Android/iOS support.
Databases – Firebase / MongoDB / SQL for storing user data.

Implementation Process (Step by Step):
1.Collect soil data, crop history, and weather details.
2.Process the data using AI/ML algorithms.
3.Generate crop, fertilizer, and pest management recommendations.
4.Deliver advisory through multilingual mobile app/chatbot.
5.Enable farmers to upload pest/disease images for diagnosis.
6.Provide alerts via SMS, app notifications, or voice call.
7.Collect farmer feedback to continuously improve recommendations.
## Feasibility and Viability
Feasibility:
AI/ML, IoT, and mobile technologies are already widely available.
Farmers already use smartphones (India has 750M+ smartphone users).
Multilingual support makes adoption easier.

Potential Challenges:
Limited internet connectivity in rural areas.
Digital illiteracy among older farmers.
Need for accurate local soil and pest datasets.

Strategies to Overcome Challenges:
Build offline-first app with SMS/USSD support.
Train farmers through NGOs and agricultural officers.
Use government partnerships to gather local soil/pest data.
## Impact and Benefits
Social Impact:
Farmers get access to trusted, scientific, and timely advice.
Reduces dependence on shopkeepers or guesswork.
Increases awareness of modern farming practices.

Economic Impact:
Reduces input costs by optimizing fertilizer/pesticide usage.
Increases crop yield and farmer income by 20–30%.
Improves access to mandi prices → better market decisions.

Environmental Impact:
Promotes sustainable farming.
Reduces overuse of chemicals → healthier soil and water.
Supports climate-resilient agriculture.
